    "1. total_sulfur_dioxide: The coefficient is negative (-1.045775). As total sulfur dioxide content increases, it is negatively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher total sulfur dioxide levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'bad.'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. volatile_acidity: The coefficient is negative (-0.562789). As volatile acidity increases, it is negatively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher levels of volatile acidity tend to make the model predict the wine as 'bad.'\n",

    "2. density: The coefficient is negative (-1.319945). As density increases, it is negatively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' In other words, higher density tends to make the model predict the wine as 'bad.'\n",

    "9. pH: The coefficient is positive (-0.082547). As pH increases, it is negatively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher pH levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'bad.'\n",

    "5. citric_acid: The coefficient is negative (-0.001191). The citric acid content has a small negative effect on predicting the wine as 'good,' but its impact is not significant compared to other features.\n",

    "11. residual_sugar: The coefficient is positive (0.218888). As residual sugar content increases, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher residual sugar levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
    "\n",
    "7. free_sulfur_dioxide: The coefficient is positive (0.291157). As free sulfur dioxide content increases, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher free sulfur dioxide levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. fixed_acidity: The coefficient is positive (0.331882). As fixed acidity increases, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher fixed acidity tends to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
    "\n",
    "7. free_sulfur_dioxide: The coefficient is positive (0.349909). As free sulfur dioxide content increases, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher free sulfur dioxide levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
    "\n",
    "6. sulphates: The coefficient is positive (0.813736). As sulphates increase, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher sulphate levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
    "\n",
    "10. alcohol: The coefficient is positive (1.020924). As alcohol content increases, it is positively associated with the likelihood of the wine being classified as 'good.' Higher alcohol levels tend to make the model predict the wine as 'good.'\n",
